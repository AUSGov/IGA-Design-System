### Overview
The standard content page is a flexible page pattern where almost all components can be used to best present the content and in an order that makes the most sense for user needs.

### Variations

#### Meet the board/committee/council

Used to introduce an authoritative body that is affliated with the entity (sometimes a fundamental part of the entity itself).

Present in two styles: large featured card leading to a separate page or in bio list on the page.

#### Subscribe

A large featured card could be included to emphasise the entity newsletter if it exists. This is usually located at the bottom of the page, just about the contact footer.
