We’re committed to making industry.gov.au websites as accessible and usable as possible.

We’ve designed our website to meet the [Australian Government Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard). This includes meeting the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG 2.0) standard at level AA.
