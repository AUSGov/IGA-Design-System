        The Australian Government, in consultation with the Australian Building Codes Office and the states and territories, undertake regulatory impact analysis on:
        <ul>
          <li>whether accessible car-parking ratios are adequate</li>
          <li>where automatic doors are used, including their use in accessible toilet facilities.</li>
          <li>the adequacy of dimensions of openings and thoroughfares in the Premises Standards and the opportunity to align with the Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport 2002 (Transport Standards).</li>
        </ul>
        This work will provide evidence for any future changes to the Premises Standards and the National Construction Code (NCC).
