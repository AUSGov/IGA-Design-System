            <li class="link-large">a lack of information on emerging wayfinding solutions</li>

          <p>Building professionals told us they needed better guidance to help them comply with the Premises Standards. They were particularly concerned about how to apply the Premises Standards to significant works on older and heritage-listed buildings.</p>
          <p>Building professionals were also concerned about the inconsistencies among disability standards, state and territory requirements and the National Construction Code (NCC).</p>
