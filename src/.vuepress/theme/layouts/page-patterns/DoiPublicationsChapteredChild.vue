      <h4 class="text-primary lead mb-0">The Disability (Access to Premises - Building) Standards 2010 (the Premises Standards) help people with disability have dignified access to buildings. Improved access to buildings can also benefit older people, people with injuries or illness, and parents and carers with young children.</h4>
      <div class="pt-4 pb-5">
        <p>The Premises Standards also help building developers, certifiers and managers ensure that buildings comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.</p>
        <p>The Premises Standards are reviewed at least once every 5 years. Senator the Hon Jonathon Duniam, Assistant Minister for Industry Development, is responsible for reviewing the Premises Standards in consultation with Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, Attorney-General. The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources supports the Minister in conducting the review.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ensure the Premises Standards are achieving their objectives</li>
          <li>help building industry stakeholders fulfil their responsibilities to people with disability</li>
          <li>identify ways to improve the Premises Standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It also examines practices in other countries to see if any lessons learnt overseas can be applied in Australia.</p>

        <h4 class="text-primary display-medium mb-3">What we heard</h4>
        <div class="pb-5">
          <p>People living with disability told us they find it easier to access premises that were built after the Premises Standards were introduced. This indicates that the Premises Standards are achieving their objectives.</p>
          <p>However, people living with disability also identified emerging issues and areas for improvement. These included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="link-large">inconsistent requirements for signage and luminance contrast</li>
            <li class="link-large">a lack of information on emerging wayfinding solutions</li>
            <li class="link-large">a lack of accessible carparks and automatic doors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These issues need to be addressed to ensure the Premises Standards continue achieving their objectives.</p>
          <p>Building professionals told us they needed better guidance to help them comply with the Premises Standards. They were particularly concerned about how to apply the Premises Standards to significant works on older and heritage-listed buildings.</p>
          <p>Building professionals were also concerned about the inconsistencies among disability standards, state and territory requirements and the National Construction Code (NCC).</p>
          <p>Many businesses emphasised a need for practical guidance, such as check lists, to help them improve access for employees when negotiating commercial leases.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately this review could not address every issue raised by stakeholders. We will continue engaging with stakeholders to address other issues.</p>

          <p>The opportunities for action align with these areas. If agreed by the government, these actions will ensure the Premises Standards continue meeting their objectives.</p>

          <p>Over a quarter of submissions identified the need for new or updated guidance to help stakeholders understand their rights and responsibilities under the Premises Standards.</p>
          <p>The guidance most in need of updating is the Australian Human Rights Commission’s Guideline on the application of the Premises Standards. This is addressed by Action 2a.</p>
          <p>Stakeholders also raised the need for guidance on signage requirements, luminance contrasting and wayfinding solutions, which they felt were often overlooked. There is still no consensus amongst majority of the stakeholders on many of these issues, and developing guidance is the first step towards considering these issues in the Premises Standards.</p>
          <p>These are all addressed by Action 2b.</p>
          <p>To properly assess whether the Premises Standards are achieving their objectives, we need data to help us measure buildings’ compliance with the standards. This is addressed by Action 3.</p>

          <p>This review identified opportunities to amend the Premises Standards to improve their effectiveness. This is addressed by Action 4a.</p>
          <p>Disability standards including the Premises Standards, the NCC and other Australian standards are updated at different times. This leads to inconsistency across the standards, which causes confusion for stakeholders. The inconsistency is addressed by Action 4b.</p>
