          <p class="text-primary link-large lead">Public buildings are central to the lives of Australians. They are where we work, shop, build community relationships and engage in Australian society. As an integral part of our society, it is important that people with disability have equal access to public buildings.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to present the outcomes of the 2021 Premises Standards Review. The Premises Standards support dignified access to public buildings for the 1 in 6 Australians living with disability.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div>
          <p>The outcomes of the review align with the work of the Australian Government under Australia's Disability Strategy to ensure people living with disability can fulfil their potential as equal members of the community.</p>
          <p>This is a vision adopted by all governments, who have committed to a national, unified approach to improving the lives of people with disability, their families and carers, and to providing leadership for a community-wide shift in attitudes.</p>
          <p>The introduction of the Premises Standards in 2010 has improved access to public buildings and opportunities for people with disability. Safe and appropriate access to public buildings enhances the independence, health and economic security of people with disability. It improves employment opportunities and contributes to more inclusive communities. An accessible built environment also benefits other Australians, such as older Australians and those with temporary injuries.</p>
          <p>The 2021 Premises Standards Review aims to ensure that our Premises Standards are achieving their objectives, and to identify opportunities for improvement or areas where barriers exist. It has been undertaken during a tumultuous time, forcing us to be innovative in our approach to stakeholder consultation. While this could have been seen as a barrier, I am proud to say that it has ultimately resulted in broader participation and input than the traditional review process.</p>
          <p>I would like to thank everyone who came together to overcome the obstacles posed by COVID-19, in particular the disability sector, and contributed their valuable insights and lived experience to the review. Your input will help to ensure the Premises Standards continue to deliver the right outcomes for people with disability. I would also like to thank the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Dr Ben Gauntlett, for his vital input to the review and chairing of the virtual town hall meeting.</p>
          <p>Improvements to the Premises Standards will help to ensure people with disability can achieve their potential through both increased employment and social opportunities. I look forward to working with my state and territory colleagues to progress the appropriate regulatory reforms based on the review findings.</p>

      <h4 class="text-primary lead pb-4">The Disability (Access to Premises - Building) Standards 2010 (the Premises Standards) help people with disability have dignified access to buildings. Improved access to buildings can also benefit older people, people with injuries or illness, and parents and carers with young children.</h4>
      <div>
        <p>The Premises Standards also help building developers, certifiers and managers ensure that buildings comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.</p>
        <p>The Premises Standards are reviewed at least once every 5 years. Senator the Hon Jonathon Duniam, Assistant Minister for Industry Development, is responsible for reviewing the Premises Standards in consultation with Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, Attorney-General. The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources supports the Minister in conducting the review.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="py-5">
        <p>The purpose of the review is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ensure the Premises Standards are achieving their objectives</li>
          <li>help building industry stakeholders fulfil their responsibilities to people with disability</li>
          <li>identify ways to improve the Premises Standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It also examines practices in other countries to see if any lessons learnt overseas can be applied in Australia.</p>

        <h4 class="text-primary display-medium mb-3">What we heard</h4>
        <div class="pb-5">
          <p>People living with disability told us they find it easier to access premises that were built after the Premises Standards were introduced. This indicates that the Premises Standards are achieving their objectives.</p>
          <p>However, people living with disability also identified emerging issues and areas for improvement. These included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>inconsistent requirements for signage and luminance contrast</li>
            <li>a lack of information on emerging wayfinding solutions</li>
            <li>a lack of accessible carparks and automatic doors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These issues need to be addressed to ensure the Premises Standards continue achieving their objectives.</p>
          <p>Building professionals told us they needed better guidance to help them comply with the Premises Standards. They were particularly concerned about how to apply the Premises Standards to significant works on older and heritage-listed buildings.</p>
          <p>Building professionals were also concerned about the inconsistencies among disability standards, state and territory requirements and the National Construction Code (NCC).</p>
          <p>Many businesses emphasised a need for practical guidance, such as check lists, to help them improve access for employees when negotiating commercial leases.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately this review could not address every issue raised by stakeholders. We will continue engaging with stakeholders to address other issues.</p>

        <div class="pb-5">
          <h4 class="text-primary display-medium mb-3">Opportunities for action</h4>
          <p>The opportunities for action align with these areas. If agreed by the government, these actions will ensure the Premises Standards continue meeting their objectives.</p>

          <p>Over a quarter of submissions identified the need for new or updated guidance to help stakeholders understand their rights and responsibilities under the Premises Standards.</p>
          <p>The guidance most in need of updating is the Australian Human Rights Commissionâ€™s Guideline on the application of the Premises Standards. This is addressed by Action 2a.</p>
          <p>Stakeholders also raised the need for guidance on signage requirements, luminance contrasting and wayfinding solutions, which they felt were often overlooked. There is still no consensus amongst majority of the stakeholders on many of these issues, and developing guidance is the first step towards considering these issues in the Premises Standards.</p>
          <p>These are all addressed by Action 2b.</p>
          <p>To properly assess whether the Premises Standards are achieving their objectives, we need data to help us measure buildingsâ€™ compliance with the standards. This is addressed by Action 3.</p>

        <div style="padding-bottom: 36px;">
          <p>We undertook the 2021 review in 3 phases to target new stakeholders (participants living with disability who may not usually participate) and established stakeholders. We also conducted a literature review to explore policy options and implementation outcomes in other countries.</p>
          <p>The 2021 review implemented quantitative and qualitative data capture processes. These let us standardise and analyse insights from the first and second reviews (and any future reviews) to drive more evidence-based policy and decision making. All submissions were recorded in a table and then analysed manually (by reading, coding and analysing every submission) and via an artificial intelligence powered platform.</p>
          <p>Submissions often raised issues across multiple key themes. Key themes were broken down into sub-themes, which were further broken down into categories. This allowed the review team to identify issues that intersect across multiple themes.</p>
          <p>This approach informed the reviewâ€™s understanding of the impact of specific issues across disability types, age groups and building types.</p>

            <p>The first phase of consultation â€“ called the â€˜discoveryâ€™ phase â€“ started on 8 September 2020 and concluded on 30 November 2020. It focused on understanding stakeholdersâ€™ experience with the Premises Standards.</p>
            <p>The discovery phase used a semi-structured survey design and open-ended questions. It asked participants for their lived experience with buildings and examples of what did and did not work for them.</p>
            <p>Accessible Easy Read versions of the survey were available. We accepted multiple methods of participation, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>emails</li>
              <li>letters</li>
              <li>audio and video submissions</li>
              <li>telephone calls.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We identified 6 key themes during the discovery phase (Figure 1):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>consistency and clarity</li>
              <li>compliance</li>
              <li>access and egress</li>
              <li>communication and wayfinding</li>

              <li>toilet and change room provisions</li>
              <li>environmental sensitivities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Stakeholder submissions from the discovery phase shaped the terms of reference and consultation paper for the second phase of the review. The second phase began following the approval of the terms of reference by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and the Attorney-General. </p>
