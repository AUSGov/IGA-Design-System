#About the design system
Our digital front door guides users through an integrated and accessible experience, providing context to the breadth of news, stories, achievements, and engagement opportunities.

This modular approach brings to life our information architecture that prioritises critical and timely information, while also presenting information according to user needs and interests.

Principles
The system upholds the industry.gov.au Website Governance Framework’s 6 governance principles:
1. Information integrity
2. Content management
3. User focus
4. Digital first
5. Accessibility
6. Readability
   System specific principles
   We complement the governance framework principles with 2 design system principles:
   User-centred design  
   We champion critical information and tasks first. We contextually promote publications, news, case studies, events and videos where there’s an established user need or business requirement.
   Our UI has no unnecessary parts. Each element is designed with purpose, and contributes to an integrated, intuitive and seamless user experience.
   Design integrity
   We follow the system rules. We do not apply any of the elements in unestablished combinations. The system works holistically and accommodates many interdependencies. We do not consider design iterations or improvements in isolation.
