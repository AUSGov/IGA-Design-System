## About our design system

<p class="h4 fw-normal">Our digital front door guides users through an integrated and accessible experience, providing context to the breadth of news, stories, achievements, and engagement opportunities.</p>

<p class="h4 fw-normal mb-4">This modular approach brings to life our information architecture that prioritises critical and timely information, while also presenting information according to user needs and interests.</p>

{ title: 'Components', linkUrl: '/components', linkText: 'Visit Page', text: 'Components are reusable patterns for our content types. They are building blocks that come together to create modular page patterns.' },
{ title: 'Page Patterns', linkUrl: '/page-patterns', linkText: 'Visit Page', text: 'These are distinct layouts that help to present information in order of timeliness and relevance, and to aid content discovery.' }

## Principles

Our design system is consistent, but flexible; integrated, but modular. Integrated to optimise page patterns for particular purposes and modular to meet various user needs. As our department and our work evolves we can more easily introduce new patterns or combine them in new ways.

### Our six governance principles from the website governance framework

We incorporate the six principles in our design system:

<BigList :lists="[
'Information integrity',
'Content management',
'User focus',
'Digital first',
'Accessibility',
'Readability',
]"/>

### How this translates to our design system

To visually capture these six principles, we’ve defined key design system principles:

<Columns :contents="[
{ title: 'People First', text: 'Our UI has no needless parts. Each element contributes to an accessible, scalable experience.<br/><br/>We place critical information in the use\'s focus and guide them with hierarchy and curation, using intuitive text styles, interactions, component designs, and page patterns.' },
{ title: 'Interconnected', text: 'Our design system connects relevant, topic-based content with contextual navigation patterns and integrated hierarchy.<br/><br/>Hub, topic and sub-topic pages relate content and allow users to self-select, drill further into information, and discover interests along the way.' },
{ title: 'Transparent', text: 'Our page patterns emphasise critical information, then contextually weave in news, publications, and events.<br/><br/>We curate related content through modular cards and offer users intuitive navigation patterns to search for and explore topics of interest.' },
]"/>
